        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>I'm passionate about crafting thoughtful solutions that meet user needs. Here, you'll find my projects in front-end development but also projects in my former field of product design, UX/UI design and user research, that showcase my skills beyond development in collaboration, workshop facilitation and design.</p>
        <p><em>Please note: this page doesn't represent all my projects, but a selection that I can show publicly.</em></p>
