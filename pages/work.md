        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>I'm passionate about crafting thoughtful solutions that meet user needs. Here, you'll find my projects in product design, UX/UI design, and user research, showcasing my skills in user-centered design, design thinking, and data-driven decision-making.</p>
        <p><i>Please note: this side is currently just a small selection of my projects. A lot of my older projects still need to be put into pictures and prose and uploaded in this portfolio.</i></p>
