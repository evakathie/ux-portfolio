        <p>Iʼm Eva, a 26 year old Product Designer from Germany. Iʼm a creative outside-the-box thinker and passionate for Design Thinking. Living in the beautiful city of Hamburg, I currently work at a Fintech company called Digitec. Iʼm responsible for the usability of a b2b software product family in the financial sector. I believe in lifelong learning and love to improve myself and to dive into new challenges and opportunities.</p>
        <p>Outside the office, I enjoy spending time in nature or at the gym. I am an environmentalist, enjoy meeting friends and learning Danish. Creativity is also a big part of my free time, I have been an amateur photographer for many years and enjoy pottery and sewing. </p>
