<h2>“be fabulous“ Blog</h2>

<p>I found my passion for blogging long before I became a Product Designer in 2012 when I started my blog “be-fabulous“. Back than it was really amateur, I hosted it on blogspot and it was more like a digital diary. But on my journey I expanded the blogs topics and learned a lot about writing, (product-) photography and also coding with HTML, CSS and in the end JavaScript. Now the blog is about Sustainability, Travel and Gardening and I'm self-hosting it since recreating the codebase with Vuepress.</p>

<h2>Garden Plan Workbook</h2>

<p>After creating a garden plan for my balcony garden every year and searching for the same information over and over again - like sowing, cultivation, planting and harvesting times or optimal light and soil conditions (fertilization level) - I decided that this is a problem to be easily solved by a workbook. So I created a 22-page digital workbook in PDF format (in my native language german) that helps you to create your own garden plan in 10 easy steps.</p>

<h2>Photography</h2>

<p>In 2013 I bought my first SLR camera, when I was 16 years old, and that started a long-lasting hobby. Since then, I've outgrown the beginner's camera and eventually swapped the mirror for a system camera. As well as experimenting with analog and polaroid cameras. I also looked into many fields of photography: People, Macro, Landscapes, Nature and Products. Next to photography I taught myself image editing with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.</p>
