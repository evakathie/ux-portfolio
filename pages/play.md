<h2>“be fabulous“ Blog</h2>

<p>I found my passion for blogging long before I joined the IT industry when I started my blog “be fabulous“ in 2012. Back than it was amateur, I hosted it on blogspot and it was more like a digital diary. But on my journey I expanded the blogs topics and learned a lot about writing, (product-) photography and also coding with HTML, CSS and in the end JavaScript. Now the blog is about Sustainability, Travel and Gardening and Iʼm self-hosting it since recreating the codebase with Vuepress.</p>

<h2>“Rethink: Garten“ Book</h2>

<p>In collaboration with the german publisher <em>Frech</em> (or “TOPP kreativ“) that is known for it's guides for handicrafts and creative projects, I wrote and published a book about sustainable gardening. The book is called “Rethink: Garten - DIYs und Lifehacks für nachhaltiges Gärtnern“ and it has 160 pages (written in german). I wrote the entire manuscript and took all the photos myself. The publisher took care of layout, editing, printing and publication. An edition of 5.000 books (softcover) was printed and published in February 2024.</p>

<h2>Garden Plan Workbook</h2>

<p>After creating a garden plan for my balcony garden every year and searching for the same information over and over again - like sowing, cultivation, planting and harvesting times or optimal light and soil conditions (fertilization level) - I decided that this is a problem to be easily solved by a workbook. So I created a 22-page digital workbook in PDF format (in my native language german) that helps to create your own garden plan in 10 easy steps. Afterwards I opened an online shop on Etsy to sell it.</p>

<h2>Photography</h2>

<p>In 2013 I bought my first SLR camera, when I was 16 years old, and that started a long-lasting hobby. Since then, Iʼve outgrown the beginnerʼs camera and eventually swapped the mirror for a system camera. As well as experimenting with analog and polaroid cameras. I also looked into many fields of photography: People, Macro, Landscapes, Nature and Products. Next to photography I taught myself image editing with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.</p>
