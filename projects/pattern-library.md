<p>Creation of a comprehensive pattern library for the D3 product family of Digitec GmbH, for documentation and standardization of used design patterns.</p>
<p>Design Pattern = generalizable solution to repeatedly occurring (UX / design) problems.</p>

<div class="wrapper">

<p>During a three month internship at Digitec GmbH I created a pattern library for their software product family D3. The D3 products D3 Sheets, D3 Curves and D3 Elements together form a pricing engine for FX and MM trading and are used  by more than 40 of the world’s leading FX trading banks. The products are developed using the programming language Scala, the user interface is designed with JavaFX and CSS.</p>

<HighlightedArea title="Summary of our Approach">
<ol>
    <li>Research and comparison of different existing pattern libraries</li>
    <li>Abstraction of the components used in the software to design patterns</li>
    <li>Design of a theoretical basic model of the pattern library based on the atomic design approach</li>
    <li>Documentation of the design patterns in the form of a pattern library project in the company's internal Confluence environment</li>
    <li>Implementation of the Design Patterns as reusable components in Adobe Xd</li>
    <li>Elimination of special solutions in the software, which are already covered by already covered by a design</li> pattern

<h3>Why create a Pattern Library?</h3>

When I came to Digitec as an intern, only one UX Designer was working there. Short after we were three people, and while all the Design Information was in the head of the Senior UX/UI Designer, there needed to be a Design System to make communication easier. Moreover, many special solutions were built into the software, which could be replaced by other more standardized patterns - if these were written down and their purpose defined. Here is a short list of the hoped-for improvements through the introduction of a pattern library:

<ul>
    <li>Avoid duplication & reuse proven solutions</li>
    <li>Increase design (& code) quality due to the elimination of special cases</li>
    <li>Simplify communication between team members</li>
    <li>Ease onboarding of new team members</li>
    <li>Avoid misunderstandings between developers and designers</li>
</ul>
