<ProjectHeader :currentPage="this">
<p>Be fabulous is my personal blog about sustainability, photography and travelling. After hosting it with blogspot for many years, I got the urge to professionalise the project and gain more control about the interface and usability.  From the ground up I rebuild the codebase using VuePress (Vue.js) and deployed and maintaine the site with git-based workflows.</p>
